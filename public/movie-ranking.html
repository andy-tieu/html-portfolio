<h1>Top Movies I Watched 2023 (Andy's Opinion)</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movie Choices</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1) Suzume</h3>
<p>- From the producer of Weathering With You and Your Name, Suzume is presented as a beautifully as the previous 2 films. 
    The soundtrack and artstyle of the anime is extrememly well done, being able to portray the feeling of the story to the viewers.
</p>

<h3>2) Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>- Haven't watched yet, but I will soon. From the trailer, the artstyle is still similar to the first movie and hopefully will not disappoint.
</p>

<h3>3) The Super Mario Bros Movie</h3>
<p>- Amazing depiction of a video game in movie form and is great for all audiences. Mario being an iconic character makes it easy for young
     and old people to recognize and also have some relation to him, whether from playing old or new video games featuring Mario.
